HR Analytics Dashboard



Solutions by STC – Workforce Insights



Project Overview



This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard designed to help HR teams, managers, and decision-makers understand workforce data at a glance.



Instead of working with large spreadsheets or raw datasets, the dashboard transforms employee data into clear numbers and visual insights, all displayed on one easy-to-read page.



The dashboard answers key HR questions related to employee count, attrition, performance, income, and tenure, enabling faster and more informed decisions.



Why This Dashboard Matters



HR departments often deal with complex and large datasets. This dashboard simplifies that process by:



Turning raw employee data into meaningful insights



Highlighting potential risk areas, such as high attrition



Supporting strategic HR decision-making



Saving time by presenting everything in one unified view



The dashboard is intentionally designed to be understandable for non-technical users, including managers and executives.



What Does the Dashboard Show?

1\. Executive Overview



The top section provides a quick snapshot of workforce health, including:



Total number of employees



Attrition rate



Average monthly income



Average performance rating



This section allows leaders to quickly assess the overall state of the organization.



2\. Workforce and Attrition Insights



This section uses visual charts to show:



Employee distribution across departments



Attrition risk by department



Performance rating distribution



These visuals help decision-makers identify patterns, trends, and potential issues without needing detailed analysis.



3\. Compensation and Workforce Trends



This section focuses on longer-term workforce insights, including:



Income distribution across departments



Employee tenure trends



These insights support understanding of salary structures and employee retention behavior.



Can HR Teams Interact with the Data?



Yes. The dashboard supports basic HR operations directly from the interface.



Add a New Employee



HR staff can add a new employee record through the dashboard.



Update Employee Income



HR staff can update the salary of an existing employee.



All updates are saved permanently and reflected immediately in the dashboard.



Where Is the Data Stored?

This ensures that:
